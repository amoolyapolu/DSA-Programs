Breadth First Search (BFS) for a Graph Algorithm:


Initialization: Enqueue the starting node into a queue and mark it as visited.
Exploration: While the queue is not empty:
Dequeue a node from the queue and visit it (e.g., print its value).
For each unvisited neighbor of the dequeued node:
Enqueue the neighbor into the queue.
Mark the neighbor as visited.

Repeat exploration process until the queue is empty


How BFS works?
Starting from the root, all the nodes at a particular level are visited first and 
then the nodes of the next level are traversed till all the nodes are visited.
